# Horizontal grid packing

Packs grids into rows so that each row expands to the full container width.
Row heights are dynamically adjusted.
Similar to [Masonry](https://github.com/desandro/masonry), but the space taken by all the grids will always be a rectangle without any jagged edges.
By being horizontal, users view the grid linearly (scan left to right, top to bottom) kind of like a comic book.

## Install

If you use [component](https://github.com/component/component), the dependencies are handled for you.
If you use [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower), the dependencies are packaged together.

```bash
component install jonathanong/horizontal-grid-packing
bower install horizontal-grid-packing
```

## API

### Layout

The HTML must strictly be a single container whose children are strictly grid elements.

```html
<div>
  <img data-width="100" data-height="320">
  <div data-aspect-ratio=".55"></div>
  <element></element>
  <element></element>
</div>
```

This library assumes you know the aspect ratio of each grid element.
Each element should either have a `data-aspect-ratio` attribute (width/height) or both `data-width` and `data-height` attributes.
If you do not know these attributes, use a library such as [imagesloaded](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded) to calculate the dimensions before using this library.
This library will not attempt to figure out the dimensions of each grid element.

### Pack(container [, options])

Returns a new instance of `Pack`.

```js
var pack = new HorizontalGridPacking(container, options)
```

`new` is optional.
`container` is the element that contains all the grids.
The `options` are:

- `height` - Target row height in pixels.
  `120` by default.
- `padding` - Padding between each grid in pixels.
  `0` by default.

Each of these options can be changed as an attribute of `pack`:

```js
// Change the target height
pack.height = Math.round(window.outerHeight / 5)
// Change the padding
pack.padding = 5
// Recalculate the grid
pack.reload()
```

Other options you may be interested are:

- `width` - the width of the grid in pixels.
  You should change this when `container`'s width changes.

### pack.reload()

Recalculates the grid.
Specifically, you would want to use this when `container` is resized:

```js
window.addEventListener('resize', function () {
  pack.width = container.clientWidth
  pack.height = Math.round(window.outerHeight / Math.PI)
  pack.reload()
})
```

### pack.destroy()

Destroys the grid and returns `container` to its original state.

### pack.create()

Creates the grid.
This is called by default.
You should only use this if the grid has been previously destroyed.

### pack.append(DocumentFragment || elements)

Append elements to the current grid.
Could either be a `DocumentFragment` instance whose child nodes are `elements`,
or an array-like variable of grid `elements`.
Appends using `DocumentFragment`, so don't worry about reflows.
